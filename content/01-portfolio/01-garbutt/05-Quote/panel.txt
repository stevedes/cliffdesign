It was an easy decision to commission Cliff Design for our brand refresh. David really stood out in the pitch process, his approach was different and this was just what we needed.  Rolling this out across all our marketing communications has been really easy and David has supported and helped us all the way. David has a logical and helpful approach and nothing is too much trouble for him, he's a pleasure to work with and I would highly recommend Cliff Design to anyone looking for cost effective and exciting ideas from an agency that thinks outside the box to help set you and your brand apart.
