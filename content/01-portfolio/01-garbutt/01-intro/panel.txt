In order to deliver a visual identity that would last, a firm grasp of the company's service lines and customer base was required. Having won the three-way pitch to develop the design concept, we set about creating a strong 'parent' brand based on an arabesque pattern (Their HQ is at Arabesque House). 6 sub-brands were born from this, each one with its own unique arabesque and colour scheme.
