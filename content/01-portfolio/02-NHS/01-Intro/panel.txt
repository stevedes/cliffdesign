This tender to provide York NHS with a new visual identity was won in collaboration with our good friends at [Scarborough Design](http://www.scarboroughdesign.com). The brief was quite clear, create a visual identity that represented their core values and was sensitive to the nature of the hospital. Gary and I built a library of pebble images and designed a simple grid which made good use of white space. After applying to a range of media, we also developed a set of guidelines so the in-house team can apply to their internal and external publications.
